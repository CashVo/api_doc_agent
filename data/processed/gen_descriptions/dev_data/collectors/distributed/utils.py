            "description": "This class is designed to manage the launch of delayed submissions in a specific application. It provides a structured approach to handling and processing delayed submissions, ensuring that they are executed at the correct time.\n\nThe class offers various functionalities, including initialization, which sets up the necessary parameters for launching delayed submissions. For instance, the '__init__' method initializes the class's internal state, allowing it to track and manage delayed submissions effectively. By utilizing this class, developers can streamline their workflow, improve efficiency, and maintain consistency in their application's behavior.",
