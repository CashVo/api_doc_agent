It provides a standardized interface for gathering and storing data, allowing developers to easily integrate data collection into their projects.\n\nThis class offers a range of functionalities, including the ability to update policy weights, iterate over collected data, shut down the collector, set a seed for reproducibility, load state dictionaries, and more. By utilizing the DataCollectorBase, developers can simplify their data management workflow and focus on other aspects of their application development.",
