            "description": "The DataCollectorBase class serves as a fundamental component for collecting and processing data in various applications. It provides a base implementation for data collection, enabling developers to seamlessly integrate data collection into their own projects.\n\nThis class offers essential methods such as `update_policy_weights_` and `next`, which enable the collection of data from diverse sources. Additionally, it may include other important attributes or methods that facilitate data processing and transformation. By leveraging these capabilities, developers can efficiently process and transform their data, ultimately enhancing the accuracy and reliability of their applications.",
